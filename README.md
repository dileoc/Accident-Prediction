  * Please download all the necessary files from the repository.
  * Make sure that the .pkl files are in the same location as the the main code life.
  * Upload each code to a Jupyter notebook and should be ran normally.
  
# Note
  * Due to the large dataset programs such as Google Colab could result in  a faster training time.
  * Google does not like us sharing our premium api_keys. If you do not have a premium key, the heatmap will still work but each box will have a "For development purposes only" covering it. If you do have a premium api_key please use it with the following command "gmaps.configure(api_key = "INSERT KEY HERE")" in the importing section.
